# Text Analyzer & Speech-to-Text (Haskell) ðŸ“„ðŸ”Š
Overview
This Haskell-based Text Analyzer processes text input to extract key insights, such as word count, readability score, sentiment analysis, and estimated reading time. It also includes a speech-to-text feature that allows users to input text using their voice.

Features
âœ… Word & Sentence Count â€“ Analyzes total words, sentences, and paragraphs.
âœ… Readability Score â€“ Estimates reading ease using a simplified Flesch-Kincaid formula.
âœ… Sentiment Analysis â€“ Determines whether the text is Positive, Negative, or Neutral.
âœ… Keyword Extraction â€“ Identifies the top 5 most frequent words (excluding common words).
âœ… Reading Time Estimation â€“ Calculates how long it would take to read the text.
âœ… Typing Speed Tracker (WPM) â€“ Measures your words per minute based on manual input.
âœ… Speech-to-Text Input â€“ Allows users to speak and convert it into text (Windows PowerShell-based).
